      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <h3>Independent Consultant, Data Science – Toronto, ON (Sep 2024 – Present)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineered a production ML API using LightGBM and 33 features to detect fraudulent insurance claims with 78% recall, managing severe class imbalance (6.4% fraud rate).</li>
        <li>Developed an end-to-end churn prediction pipeline achieving 86% recall using Balanced Random Forest, with performance optimized via Optuna hyperparameter tuning across 100 trials.</li>
        <li>Deployed containerized FastAPI services with Docker, ensuring latency of &lt;100ms for real-time insurance analytics applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Operations Data Analyst, Manulife – Toronto, ON (Feb 2024 – Sep 2024)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzed claims payment data using Python and SQL to identify root causes of processing delays, segmenting data by time, value, and payment method to uncover trends and enable corrective actions.</li>
        <li>Created an automated reporting solution using Python and SQL that generated filtered operational reports, reducing manual reporting time from hours to minutes and improving data accuracy.</li>
        <li>Improved escalated case processing workflow by testing and documenting case flows across multiple departments, reducing turnaround time by identifying process bottlenecks.</li>
        <li>Built Excel tracking systems and coordinated a cross-functional testing team to validate workflow changes while documenting processes and creating job aids for new team members.</li>
